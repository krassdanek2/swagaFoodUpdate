For example, when you visit one of our websites or use one of our Services, create an account with us, buy a stored-value card online, participate in a survey or promotion, we may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender, street address, or mobile phone number so that we can provide Services to you.

                <p><strong>Data About Your Use of the Services</strong>. In addition to the personal data you provide to us directly, we may collect personal data about your use of the Services. For example, we may collect:<br>• Device information — such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, and settings of the device you use to access the Services.<br>• Usage information — such as information about the Services you use, the time and duration of your use of the Services and other information about your interaction with content offered through a Service, and any information stored in cookies and similar technologies that we have set on your device.<br>• Location information — such as your computer’s IP address, your mobile device’s GPS signal or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use the Services.</p>



                <p><strong>Data From Third-Party Sources.</strong> We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you.

                <p>We will keep your personal data for as long as it is needed to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected (e.g. if it was collected for the performance of a contract your personal data will be stored for the duration of the contractual relationship to fulfill the contract) and in order to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.

                <p>The following provides information about entities with which we may share your personal data. Our practices vary depending on the type of personal data and sharing.</p>



                <p><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share personal data within our family of affiliated companies so that we may provide offers from those companies that may be relevant to you, better understand your preferences, and improve our Services.</p>



                <p><strong>Franchisees.</strong> We may share personal data with local owners of BURGER KING®, TIM HORTONS®, and POPEYES® restaurants, particularly when they will work with us in delivering Services to you. For example, local restaurants will implement delivery and take-away services that you may request through the Services. We also may provide our franchisees with personal data so that a local restaurant may provide you with offers and promotions that might interest you.</p>



                <p><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may also share your personal data with business partners to provide you with Services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs on our Services but that is sponsored or co-sponsored by another company, your personal data may be shared with that sponsor. Please be aware that these entities can have their own privacy practices establishing different rules than the ones stipulated in this Policy. Therefore, we recommend you review their privacy policies carefully.</p>



                <p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may share personal data with companies providing services on our behalf, such as delivery services, hosting vendors, advertising service providers, data analytics companies, marketing service companies, and list managers. We also may share your personal data, including your payment information, as appropriate to process your payments for the Services or complete a transaction. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal data for their own marketing or other unrelated purposes.</p>
