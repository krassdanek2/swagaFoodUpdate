                <p>Except where prohibited by applicable law, the following terms apply to all legal disputes between you and RBI. These Terms are governed by the laws of Ireland. Except where prohibited by applicable law (including your statutory rights as consumer), by using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions.

If you and RBI do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p>

You agree that RBI may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Ireland, necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. In the event a dispute cannot, by applicable law, be subject to binding arbitration, the parties hereto irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.</p>
